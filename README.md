- 👋 Hi, I’m @skribe
- 👀 I’m a writer, so I'm interested in tales and stories, but also words and their etymologies.  
- 🌱 I’m currently relearning how to code again.  It's something I've done on and off since the early 80s, but until recently I was mostly self-taught (not counting my BASIC tutor at university that didn't know BASIC.  She used to wander around the classroom smoking a cigar and telling us how C was a much better language.  She was right but... ).
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate.  I'm still in the process of learning again.  Maybe in a few years.
